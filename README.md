This program is used to collect your own data from the Opal website. While the website does allow you to download your own data in PDF, it isn't particularly useful if you want to do some analysis on the data. This code saves your data in CSV. Currently uses the Firefox browser.

## Requirements
* Python 2.7
* Selenium
* Firefox
* Opal account with linked card
